# tyche-poker

Me and the bois like to play Poker. In the COVID-19 lockdown of 2020, we have been playing Poker online using a combo of (http://playingcards.io + http://playingcards.io). With my new found Spring skills, I thought that I could make something better.

Objectives
1. to be able to play with my mates and replace our current Poker situation
2. to learn some new shizz and stretch my shkills
3. to have a bang-tidy project on my GitHub

Status (May 2020)
* Objectives 2 and 3 were achieved. 
* Objective 1 did not happen. With a looming deadline to pass my Java OCA exam, I have had to park Tyche as it is. It is PRETTY MUCH done but it is not production ready. I have not tested it with other people and I atm I'm not going to. I have learnt TONNES and am intent of reusing lots of this code in future projects :)
* Maybe I am using pragmatism as an excuse for non-perfection...

## Design

Architecture
* The application consists of 3 microservices (the frontend - React JS, the backend 'poker' - Spring Boot, the hand evaluator service 'evaluate' - Node JS) and is designed to run on Cloud Foundry. If I was running in production, I would use my CF trial account.
